# Csgo-Object-Detection

## Project Description

The Csgo-Object-Detection project focuses on enabling the auto-navigation of player movements within the game. It achieves this by interpreting hand gestures captured from a webcam input, allowing players to control their in-game character's movements.

Additionally, the project leverages an object detection module to identify and shoot targets within the game, providing players with an automated and interactive gaming experience.

Use this project to explore the exciting possibilities of integrating computer vision and gesture recognition into your gaming experience. Have fun and enjoy your gaming adventure!

## Prerequisites

Before using the Csgo-Object-Detection project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Tensorflow Object Detection:** You'll need to install and configure the TensorFlow object detection API. You can find the official repository for TensorFlow object detection [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).

2. **Frozen Inference Graph:** Download the frozen inference graph from [this link](https://github.com/datitran/object_detector_app/blob/master/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_11_06_2017/frozen_inference_graph.pb) and ensure it is available for your project.

3. **Frozen Inference CSGO:** Download the frozen inference CSGO model from [this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U6JBcTKPEG9pxviCidVhkPe459XSJlXm) and make sure to have it ready.

4. **Install Dependencies:** `pip install requirements.txt`
